You already know JavaScript, you are coding in JS for a while. You have heard of JavaScript’s weird parts and you have used JavaScript in both front (React.js Angular or Vue.js) and back end with Node.js. Sounds like you ? well now you want to take your understanding of JS to a next level. You want to know what’s happening underneath the hood, you want to learn how the single threaded system handles concurrency in JS, how the compilers work and how JS runtimes like v8 is revolutionizing modern web applications. So where do you start ?

I have stumbled upon the same questions over and over. Finally I have compiled a list of useful topics and resources that helped me further my knowledge of JavaScript as well as modern web application. Below I have listed the main topics that I felt is absolutely necessary. I have also listed some helpful resources that summarizes the subject but feel free to research more and dig deeper.

## 1.  **Event Loop and Concurrency**
    



Know how the Event loop handles concurrency in javascript. This is a crucial topic to understand. If you don’t understand how the event loop works chances are you are still a junior developer, just kidding ;)

Here are couple resources that describes event loop and concurrency handling in javascript

[Event loop Mozilla](\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop\" "\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop\"")

[blog carbon5 event-loop](\"https://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/10/27/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/\" "\"https://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/10/27/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/\"")

It is always a good idea to learn about the non blocking asynchronous I/O of node.js. Here’s a stack overflow post that I found extremely helpful

[non blocking or asynchronous (stackoverflow)](\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10570246/what-is-non-blocking-or-asynchronous-i-o-in-node-js\" "\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10570246/what-is-non-blocking-or-asynchronous-i-o-in-node-js\"")

## **2\. JIT (Just In Time Compilers)**

This is one is a broad topic, nevertheless pretty useful while you are building applications to scale. Learn about the various runtimes of JavaScript especially **V8.** You will be significantly optimize your application (especially if you are using Nodejs in the backend) once you have learned how JavaScript runtimes work. Here’s a very interesting article that I found about the common performance pitfalls of Node.js.

This will also give you a more lower level understanding of Nodejs.

## **3\. Closure**

Closure is a popular topic in JavaScript. It has gained significant popularity in javascript that other programming languages such as Python is adopting it. Here’s a free code camp article about closures.

## **4\. Higher Order Functions**

Learn how the higher order functions work.

Resources:

[High Order Functions](\"https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-75461803bad\" "\"https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-75461803bad\"")

## **5\. Learn to Memoize**

Learn how to use Memoize in JS. This topic is directly related to performance.

To learn more:

[Memoization](\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-memoize-in-javascript-51d07d19430e\" "\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-memoize-in-javascript-51d07d19430e\"")

Hope this list was helpful. I would love to know your thoughts about other interesting topics in JS, feel free to drop a comment.
